# Investigation on Using Thick Data Analytics in Medical Paradigm

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This MSc project explores how to achieve reliable learning from small, high-quality ("thick") data in medicine, where large labeled datasets are often scarce.  

The work progresses through:  
- **Chapter 2** â€“ Baseline CNN experiments on medical imaging  
- **Chapter 3** â€“ Few-shot learning with domain heuristics  
- **Chapter 4** â€“ Augmentation & ROI-based approaches  
- **Chapter 5** â€“ Conclusions & future work

## ðŸ—‚ Repository Structure
- `writing/`  Proposal draft, chapters  
- `prototyping/`  Jupyter notebooks (week-01, week-02, â€¦)  
- `docs/` Timeline, mind maps, notes  
- `papers/` Research papers (to be added)

## ðŸ“† Weekly Progress
- **Week 01:** Repo setup, environment check, initial proposal & timeline  
- **Week 02 (current):** Dataset selection, baseline CNN setup, updated mind map  
- ### Week 03 (current)
- âœ… Environment setup on Apple Silicon (MPS enabled).
- âœ… Saved reproducibility snapshot: [`requirements-week-03.txt`](prototyping/week-03/requirements-week-03.txt).
- âœ… Implemented results-saving pipeline (figures + model checkpoints in [`week-03/results/`](prototyping/week-03/results/)).
- âœ… Downloaded and explored MedMNIST subsets:
  - **ChestMNIST** (multi-label chest X-rays, 14 classes)  
  - **PneumoniaMNIST** (binary chest X-rays: pneumonia vs normal)  
  - **BreastMNIST** (binary ultrasound: benign vs malignant)  
- âœ… Sample visualizations (inline + saved):  
  ![ChestMNIST samples](prototyping/week-03/results/chestmnist_samples.png)  
  ![PneumoniaMNIST samples](prototyping/week-03/results/pneumoniamnist_samples.png)  
  ![BreastMNIST samples](prototyping/week-03/results/breastmnist_samples.png)  
- ðŸ”„ Next: class balance analysis, train/val/test splits, ResNet-18 baseline training.
